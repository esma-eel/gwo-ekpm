# Master Thesis Project: Examining the role of active users in social networks using the gray wolf optimization algorithm

## Introduction
Unverisity: [University of Science and Culture](https://usc.ac.ir/)
This project explores the application of the Gray Wolf Optimization (GWO) algorithm for influence maximization in social networks. Conducted as part of a master's degree in Information Technology for E-commerce Engineering, the research aims to understand and optimize the spread of influence within online communities.

## Objectives

- To implement the Gray Wolf Optimization algorithm for identifying influential nodes in social networks.
- To evaluate the effectiveness of GWO in maximizing influence compared to traditional methods.
- To analyze the impact of various dataset characteristics on the performance of the GWO algorithm.
- To evaluate proposed method named EKPM compared to GWIM

## Datasets Used

- **pgp**: A dataset representing a collection of PGP public keys, used to study the propagation of trust within a community.
- **astro-ph**: A dataset from arXiv's astrophysics section, examining the dissemination of scientific papers among researchers.
- **ham**: A dataset derived from the HAM (Healthcare and Medical) dataset, focusing on the spread of health-related information.

## Timeline

- Project Completion Date: September 11, 2023

The decision to make this project public stems from a desire to support fellow students and researchers interested in exploring innovative algorithms for social network analysis.

## Main Article

The primary publication associated with this project is available at [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S095741741930689X?via%3Dihub). This article presents the theoretical foundation, methodology, and findings of the research conducted.

## Methodology

Due to the unavailability of the original source code, the implementation of the GWO algorithm was developed from scratch based on the descriptions and sample code provided in the referenced article. This approach allowed for a thorough understanding of the algorithm's workings and facilitated customization for the specific datasets used.
